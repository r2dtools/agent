## Secure your website with SSL/TLS certificate

R2DTools makes it possible to issue a Let`s Encrypt certificate for a website in a few clicks via a user-friendly interface.

If you have an already issued certificate ( with .pem extension ) you can just upload it and R2DTools will secure your website with the uploaded certificate.
